  - set_from_related should take undef
  - ResultSource objects caching ->resultset causes interesting problems
  - find why XSUB dumper kills schema in Catalyst (may be Pg only?)

  - find a way to un-wantarray search without breaking compat
  - delay relationship setup if done via ->load_classes
  - double-sided relationships
  - make short form of class specifier in relationships work

 - Create a DBIx::Class::FilterColumn to replace inflate/deflate. This 
   component would provide a new syntax for filtering column update and 
   retrieval through a simple syntax. The syntax would be:
   __PACKAGE__->add_columns(phone => { set=>sub{ ... }, get=>sub{ ... } }); 
   We should still support the old inflate/deflate syntax, but this new 
   way should be recommended.

 - Support table locking.

 - When subclassing a dbic class make it so you don't have to do 
   __PACKAGE__->table(__PACKAGE__->table()); for the result set to 
   return the correct object type.

 Add the ability for deploy to be given a directory and grab <dbname>.sql 
 out of there if available. Try SQL::Translator if not. If none of the above, 
 cry (and die()).  Then you can have a script that pre-gens for all available 
 SQLT modules so an app can do its own deploy without SQLT on the target 
 system

 Add the search attributes "limit" and "rows_per_page".
 limit: work as expected just like offset does
 rows_per_page: only be used if you used the page attr or called $rs->page
 rows: modify to be an alias that gets used to populate either as appropriate, 
       if you haven't specified one of the others

  - Rewrite the test suite to rely on $schema->deploy, allowing for seamless
    testing of various RDBMS using the same tests
  - Automatically infer quote_char/name_sep from $schema->storage
  - Fix and properly test chained search attribute merging
  - Recursive update() (all code seems to be already available)
