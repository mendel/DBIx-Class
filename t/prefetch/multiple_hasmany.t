__END__
The solution is to rewrite ResultSet->_collapse_result() and
ResultSource->resolve_prefetch() to focus on the final results from the collapse
of the data. Right now, the code doesn't treat the columns from the various
tables as grouped entities. While there is a concept of hierarchy (so that
prefetching down relationships does work as expected), there is no idea of what
the final product should look like and how the various columns in the row would
play together. So, the actual prefetch datastructure from the search would be
very useful in working through this problem. We already have access to the PKs
and sundry for those. So, when collapsing the search result, we know we are
looking for 1 cd object. We also know we're looking for tracks and tags records
-independently- of each other. So, we can grab the data for tracks and data for
tags separately, uniqueing on the PK as appropriate. Then, when we're done with
the given cd object's datastream, we know we're good. This should work for all
the various scenarios.

My reccommendation is the row's data is preprocessed first, breaking it up into
the data for each of the component tables. (This could be done in the single
table case, too, but probably isn't necessary.) So, starting with something
like:
  my $row = {
    t1.col1 => 1,
    t1.col2 => 2,
    t2.col1 => 3,
    t2.col2 => 4,
    t3.col1 => 5,
    t3.col2 => 6,
  };
it is massaged to look something like:
  my $row_massaged = {
    t1 => { col1 => 1, col2 => 2 },
    t2 => { col1 => 3, col2 => 4 },
    t3 => { col1 => 5, col2 => 6 },
  };
At this point, find the stuff that's different is easy enough to do and slotting
things into the right spot is, likewise, pretty straightforward.

This implies that the collapse attribute can probably disappear or, at the
least, be turned into a boolean (which is how it's used in every other place).
